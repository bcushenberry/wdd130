                <h2>Disney in Japan</h2>
                <p>
                    Disney is hugely popular in Japan, which is made abundantly apparent from the many exclusives that are launched here. While sm-home are released in stores such as the Disney Flagship Store in downtown Tokyo, the majority of the exclusives are reserved for the Disney parks themselves.
