                <p>
                    Disney has long been hugely popular in Japan, which was the second country in the world to get its Disney theme park and the first outside of the US.
                    <br>
                    As such, there is a large variety of merchandise to be found, including exclusive lineups available only at Disney Sea - Japan's unique Disney park located next to Tokyo Disneyland.
                    <br>
                    Additionally, there are Disney stores in and around the greater Tokyo area, as well as the Disney Flagship Store in downtown Tokyo, which offers many items year-round and its own exclusive lineups.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We take regular trips to Disneyland and Disney Sea and make sure we're there for every major launch during the year.
                    <br>
                    What's more, we make regular visits to the Flagship Store in Shinjuku for non-park exclusives and seasonal merchandise!
                    <br>
                    If you're hankering for the latest Mickey merch or want to spend a bit more time with Duffy and Friends, we've got you covered!
