      <h3>Disney Exclusives</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Disney in Japan</strong><br>
        Disney is hugely popular in Japan, which is made abundantly apparent from the many exclusives that are launched here. While sm-home are released in stores such as the Disney Flagship Store in downtown Tokyo, the majority of the exclusives are reserved for the Disney parks themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>We've Got You Covered!</strong><br>
        But no need to worry! Ore ni omakase! ("Leave it to me!") We take regular trips to Disneyland and Disney Sea and make sure we're there for every major launch during the year. What's more, we have immediate access to the Flagship Store and visit it regularly. If you're hankering for the latest Mickey merch or want to spend a bit more time with Duffy and Friends, we've got you covered!

      <h3>Starbucks Exclusives</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Starbucks in Japan</strong><br>
        Starbucks tumblers have long been the object of many a collector's eye, and the coffee giant's seasonal offerings in Japan could comfortably fit in anyone's collection! From exclusive designs that incorporate the creative, adorable aesthetic found throughout Japanese pop culture, to special exclusive crossovers like the recent Snoopy lineup, there's sure to be something for everyone, coffee lover or not!
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>The Starbucks Reserve Roastery</strong><br>
        In addition to the regular Starbucks merchandise, there is also a special Starbucks Roastery in Tokyo that features exclusive merchandise of its own! Positioned as a higher-end type of Starbucks, the tumblers and other products offered exhibit a certain flair that differentiate them from standard Starbucks fare.

        Wireframes
      </h2>
      <p>
        Create three wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them here</p>

      <h3>Home</h3>
      <p>         
        I thought it would be nice to make a sort of brand banner at the top with the site name and perhaps some sort of catch copy. The links will then be below that, and there will be a couple sections each with a header, text, and an image. The first blurb of text on the homepage doesn't have a header because it's just the introduction.
      </p>

      <h3>Disney</h3>
      <p>         
        The first two sections show larger images with general introductory-type text, while the third section consists of three images of sample products and a small blurb beneath that say "These are some cool sample products!". The design for both the child pages is the same since they serve the same purpose.
