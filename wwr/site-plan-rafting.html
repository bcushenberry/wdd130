    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>The Dry Oar has seen much success up until now conducting all of our business via fax, but in recent years our younger customer base has dried up even more than our oars. In order to grow our business, expand our customer base, and ensure we remain the biggest (and technically only) white water rafting business in these parts, we need a website that will act as a portal for information concerning our business. Additionally, it will need to support making reservations, and customers will need to be able contact us with any questions or concerns they may have.</p>
    <!-- change this -->

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>Our older customer base is already well established, so our targets for this website are Generations M and Z. These will be younger people who are coming up or already established in their careers, most of whom likely are unmarried and thus have greater disposable income than those who may have children or other dependants. They're looking for new experiences and hobbies, and if they're not already our customer then it means they've not yet discovered the thrill of white water rafting. Given the diversity across these two generations, we'll need to optimize the site for all devices - desktop, laptop, and mobile alike.</p>
